# Warehouse Inventory Optimization using Machine Learning

A complete end-to-end data science project focused on optimizing warehouse operations and inventory using machine learning. Developed as part of an internship at **OneYes Technologies**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project aims to optimize warehouse inventory by analyzing supply chain data, forecasting demand, and improving fulfillment rates using machine learning. It includes data preprocessing, model training, performance evaluation, and deployment via Streamlit, along with an interactive Power BI dashboard for business insights.
